INTRODUCTION

Proteins are large molecules. Their blueprints are encoded in the DNA of biological organisms. 
Each protein consists of many amino acids: for example, our protein of interest consists of a little less than 400 amino acids.
Once the protein is created (synthesized), it folds into a 3D structure.
The mutations influence what amino acids make up the protein, and hence have an effect on its shape.


The goal of this task is to classify mutations of a human antibody protein into active (1) and inactive (0) based on the 
provided mutation information. Under active mutations the protein retains its original function, and inactive mutation cause 
the protein to lose its function. The mutations differ from each other by 4 amino acids in 4 respective sites. 
The sites or locations of the mutations are fixed. The amino acids at the 4 mutation sites are given as 4-letter combinations, 
where each letter denotes the amino acid at the corresponding mutation site. Amino acids at other places are kept the same and 
are not provided.

For example, FCDI corresponds to amino acid F (Phenylanine) being in the first site, amino acid C (Cysteine) being in the 
second site and so on. The biological and chemical aspects can be abstracted to solve this task.
