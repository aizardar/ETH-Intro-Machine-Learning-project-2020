In this project, our aim is to predict sepsis in patients. 

We start by addressing the missing features both in training and test set. we impute the missing values of each feature using mean value from first nearest neighbours . This is done for each unique patient id. Sklearn’s KNNImputer class is used for the imputation.
Following the data imputation, we extract seven new standard set of features - minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation, median, skewness, and kurtosis from each feature for every unique patient id.
These new features for every patient are then used to fit the model. 

For task 1 and 2, RandomForestClassifier gave better auc score than SVC.

For task 3, again RandomForestRegressor was found to give better r2 score than linear regressor except for LABEL_SaO2. 


  

For subtask 1 and 2, we find random forest classifier to give better roc_auc scores on the validation set. Sklearn’s RandomForestClassifier is used for the training. Predictions between 0 and 1 are made by predicting the probability on the test data. 


For subtask 3, we find random forest regressor to give better r2 score on the validation set except LABEL_SpO2 for which linear regression gave better r2 score. Again, we use Sklearn’s relevant classes for training. 

On further hyperparameter tuning of both random forest classifier and random forest regressor, we find n_estimator = 200 to give better roc_auc and r2 score, respectively. 

To obtain the solution of subtasks 1 and 2, we use a random forest classifier. For subtask 3, we use linear regression - to predict mean value of SpO2 and random forest regression to predict mean values of the rest of key vital signs.
